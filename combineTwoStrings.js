// this is an arrow function that combines two strings.
//here your passing in "anything" and "foo"
//the result will be "anythingfoo"

//let combineTwoStrings=(str1,str2)=> str1+str2; console.log("combination successful"). adding clog was behaving oddly, untill formated as follows...

let combineTwoStrings=(str1,str2)=> {
                console.log("combination successful");             //problem here is this clog doesnt indicate a real validation. no real validation logic. just a message.  
               return str1+str2;
                                    }
