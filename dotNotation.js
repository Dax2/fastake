//the dot operator is odd. Initially thought you could only use it on objects and variables but you can acually directly manipulate a string without first making it a variable 

let greeting= "hello";      //this how I would typically do this.

greeting.length             // returns 5

"hello".length              //however this gets 5 also. just SEEMS sloppy to me?
