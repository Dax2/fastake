/*here I'm just refreshing knowledge on basic css situations*/

/*style in html file via attribut (<h1 styel="color:blue;">)
or in a style block in the head 
<style>
h2 {
color:red; }
</style>


link to external css file in the html head
<link rel yadayada yada yada.>

*/
 

h2 {
  color:red;
}

/* ok so here is the break down...
add this to the head of your html file.*/

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">


/*notice, href is set equal to "styel.css" let me explain:
you need to make a file called style.css.
the tag above links to that file.
I could have created that file with any name for example "iCantWaitUntillSummer.css"

in which case my link would look like this...*/ 


<link rel="stylesheet" href="iCantWaitUntillSummer.css">


/* as long as they match, your good. 

Side Note: you will want to keep this name short and simple.
Big Picture: If you aren't used to how "computers work" 
heres a "thing" you migh asswell know: your html and your
css file need to be in the same folder in order to work AS TYPED IN THIS EXAMPLE.
Thats because at the simplest level, your computer is like a puppy.
The files you make are like toys and food and water etc.
You need to keep all those toys(files) in the same room(folder)
as the puppy(your computers attention). If you put all that puppys
food and water and toys in the same room it will have no 
problem playing, and drinking and eating. However,
if your freind puts food in the 
puppys bowl and bowl is in the kitchen down the hall,
the puppy will have no idea. It hasent learned about hallways,
kitchens, bowls and how to search for them yet.
If you want a puppy to eat you have to put the food
RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT. Thats how a computer is.
If you want it to know where index.html, style.css and index.js is
youve gotta put them all the same file. A tutorial will
often call it "myproject" file or "myfirstapp" file or something.

Now hold on to your brain because heres a little more info.
You can tell the puppy(computers attention) to look for
food in the kitchen(find files wherever you put them).



if your css file was not in "myproject" but instead was
on your "desktop" in a folder called "learntocode" and
in that folder you had another folder called "howtomakewebpages"
and in that one you had a folder calles "allmycsswork" 
and in that folder you had a file called "bluebackground.css"
then you could use that file by linking this way. */

<link rel="stylesheet" href="desktop/learntocode/howtomakewebpages/allmycsswork/bluebackground.css">
